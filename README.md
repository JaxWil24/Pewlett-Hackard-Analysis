## Results

## Summary
* How many roles need filled?
	* 25,916 Senior Engineers
	* 24,926 Senior Staff
	* 9,285 Engineers
	* 7,636 Staff
	* 3,603 Technique Leaders
	* 1,090 Assistant Engineers
	* 2 Managers
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in departments to mentor the next generation?
	* They appear to have enough staff to mentor the next generation of employees.
* A good table to add would be a “new hire count.” This would be similar to the “retiring titles” table. The table would provide a more accurate answer to determine how many mentorship-eligible employees are coming into which field. 
* Another beneficial table would be connecting eligible employees with close-to-retirees. Similar to “student:faculty” numbers in school, this would allow a better analysis on how many mentors per new hire. This table would also help the company keep a better record for when a position needs to find a new employee.
